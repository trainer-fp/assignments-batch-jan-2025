## Advanced SQL Queries

### Joins

Joins are essential for combining data from multiple tables based on related columns. They help you answer complex queries by linking tables together.

#### INNER JOIN
- **What it Does:** Returns only the records where there is a match in both tables.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
  FROM employees
  INNER JOIN departments 
    ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
  ```
  *This query retrieves the names of employees along with their department names, but only for employees that belong to a department.*

#### LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
- **What it Does:** Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, orders.order_id
  FROM employees
  LEFT JOIN orders 
    ON employees.employee_id = orders.employee_id;
  ```
  *This query shows all employees, including those who may not have any orders.*

#### RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
- **What it Does:** Returns all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the left side.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, orders.order_id
  FROM employees
  RIGHT JOIN orders 
    ON employees.employee_id = orders.employee_id;
  ```
  *This query returns all orders, even if some orders are not linked to an employee.*

### Grouping and Aggregation

Grouping allows you to summarize data, which is useful for generating reports and insights.

#### GROUP BY
- **What it Does:** Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns so aggregate functions can be applied to each group.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS num_employees
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id;
  ```
  *This query counts the number of employees in each department.*

#### HAVING
- **What it Does:** Filters groups after the aggregation has been applied. It works like the WHERE clause but for groups.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS num_employees
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id
  HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 10;
  ```
  *This query returns only those departments that have more than 10 employees.*

### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on sets of rows and return a single value. They are critical for summarizing data.

- **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders;
  ```
- **SUM()**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_sales FROM sales;
  ```
- **AVG()**: Returns the average of a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
  ```
- **MIN() / MAX()**: Returns the minimum or maximum value.
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(price) AS lowest_price, MAX(price) AS highest_price FROM products;
  ```

## Transactions and ACID Properties

Transactions ensure that a series of operations are executed reliably and maintain data integrity.

### ACID Explained

ACID stands for:
- **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction are treated as a single unit. If any part fails, the entire transaction fails.
- **Consistency:** A transaction must leave the database in a consistent state, following all rules and constraints.
- **Isolation:** Transactions are executed independently without interference from concurrent operations.
- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in the case of a system failure.

### Transaction Commands: BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

- **BEGIN**: Starts a new transaction.
  ```sql
  BEGIN;
  ```
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the transaction.
  ```sql
  COMMIT;
  ```
- **ROLLBACK**: Reverts all changes if an error occurs during the transaction.
  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

## Database Schema Design and Normalization

Normalization is the process of structuring a database to minimize redundancy and improve integrity.

### Normalization Basics

#### First Normal Form (1NF)
- **Goal:** Ensure each column contains atomic, indivisible values.

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- **Goal:** Remove partial dependencies so that non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- **Goal:** Remove transitive dependencies, ensuring non-key attributes depend solely on the primary key.

## Indexing

Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval.

### When to Use Indexes
- **Frequent Query Filtering**
- **High Read Frequency**
- **Sorting Performance Improvements**
