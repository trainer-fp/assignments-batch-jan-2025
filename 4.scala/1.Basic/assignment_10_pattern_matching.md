# Assignment 10: Pattern Matching

## Objective
Master pattern matching to simplify code that branches based on value or structure.

## Learning Outcomes
- Use pattern matching with different data types.
- Implement deep pattern matching with case classes.
- Apply guards in pattern matching.

## Tasks

### 1. Pattern Matching with Types
- Write a function `describe(x: Any): String` that returns a description based on the type of `x`.

### 2. Case Class Matching
- Use pattern matching to deconstruct a `Person` case class and extract properties.

### 3. Pattern Guards
- Implement a function that classifies numbers as `"small even"`, `"large even"`, `"small odd"`, or `"large odd"`.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should confirm that pattern matching works correctly for various inputs.
- Ensure that guards are applied properly.
