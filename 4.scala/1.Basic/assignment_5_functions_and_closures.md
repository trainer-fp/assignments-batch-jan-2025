# Assignment 5: Functions and Closures

## Objective
Understand how to define and use functions, including anonymous functions and closures.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define named and anonymous functions.
- Utilize closures that capture variables from their environment.
- Implement higher-order functions.

## Tasks

### 1. Function Definitions
- Write a function `computeArea(radius: Double): Double` to calculate the area of a circle.

### 2. Anonymous Functions
- Use an anonymous function to sort a list of integers in descending order.

### 3. Closures
- Implement a function `makeAdder(x: Int): Int => Int` that returns a function adding `x` to its argument.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should confirm that functions return correct results.
- Verify that the closure `makeAdder` behaves as expected.
