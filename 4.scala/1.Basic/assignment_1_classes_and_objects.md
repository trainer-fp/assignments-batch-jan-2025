# Assignment 1: Classes and Objects

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of Scala classes and objects, including class definitions, constructors, and object instantiation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define classes with properties and methods.
- Instantiate objects from classes.
- Use companion objects for static members.

## Tasks

### 1. Define a Person Class
- Create a class `Person` with properties `name` (String) and `age` (Int).
- Implement methods `greet` to print a greeting message.

### 2. Instantiate Objects
- Create instances of `Person` and invoke the `greet` method.

### 3. Companion Object
- Implement a companion object for `Person` with a method `apply` to create a `Person` without using the `new` keyword.

### 4. Validation
- Write unit tests to verify object creation and method functionality.
- Ensure that the `greet` method outputs the correct message.
