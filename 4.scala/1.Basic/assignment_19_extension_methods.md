# Assignment 19: Extension Methods

## Objective
Enhance existing types by adding new methods using extension methods.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define extension methods for standard library types.
- Use extension methods with generic types.
- Understand scoping rules for extension methods.

## Tasks

### 1. Simple Extension Method
- Add a method `isPalindrome` to `String` that checks if the string is a palindrome.

### 2. Generic Extension Method
- Implement an extension method `second` for `List[T]` that returns the second element.

### 3. Validation
- Unit tests should verify the correctness of extension methods.
- Ensure that methods are available where intended.
