# Assignment 17: Abstract Members

## Objective
Implement abstract classes and traits with abstract members.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define abstract classes and traits.
- Implement concrete subclasses that provide definitions for abstract members.
- Use abstract fields and methods.

## Tasks

### 1. Abstract Class
- Create an abstract class `Shape` with abstract methods `area` and `perimeter`.

### 2. Concrete Implementations
- Implement `Circle` and `Rectangle` subclasses.

### 3. Abstract Traits
- Define a trait `Drawable` with an abstract method `draw`.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should verify that subclasses correctly implement abstract members.
- Ensure that the `draw` method behaves appropriately.
