# Assignment 11: Working with Lists

## Objective
Work with Scala's `List` collection to perform common operations.

## Learning Outcomes
- Create and manipulate lists.
- Use higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Understand list immutability.

## Tasks

### 1. List Operations
- Create a list of integers and perform operations:
  - Double each element.
  - Filter out even numbers.
  - Calculate the sum of elements.

### 2. Recursive Functions
- Implement a recursive function `sumList(lst: List[Int]): Int`.

### 3. Immutability
- Demonstrate that lists are immutable by attempting to modify an element.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should verify the results of list operations.
- Confirm that attempting to modify a list results in a compilation error.
