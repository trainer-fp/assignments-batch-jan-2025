# Assignment 2: Basic Types and Operations

## Objective
Explore Scala's basic data types, variables, and fundamental operations.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand value types (`Int`, `Double`, `Boolean`, etc.).
- Perform arithmetic and logical operations.
- Differentiate between `val` (immutable) and `var` (mutable).

## Tasks

### 1. Variable Declarations
- Declare variables using `val` and `var` with different data types.
- Attempt to reassign `val` variables and observe the compiler error.

### 2. Arithmetic Operations
- Write functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handle division by zero exceptions.

### 3. Logical Operations
- Implement functions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should verify correct results for arithmetic and logical operations.
- Ensure that reassigning `val` variables results in a compilation error.
