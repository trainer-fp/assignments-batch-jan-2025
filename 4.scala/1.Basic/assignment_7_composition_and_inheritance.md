# Assignment 7: Composition and Inheritance

## Objective
Explore object-oriented concepts of composition and inheritance in Scala.

## Learning Outcomes
- Extend classes using inheritance.
- Override methods and use `super`.
- Implement composition to build complex types.

## Tasks

### 1. Class Hierarchy
- Define a base class `Animal` with a method `speak`.
- Create subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` that override `speak`.

### 2. Composition
- Implement a class `Zoo` that contains a list of `Animals`.

### 3. Method Overriding
- Use `super` to call the base class method within the overridden method.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should verify that `speak` behaves differently for each subclass.
- Confirm that the `Zoo` class can manage its collection of animals.
