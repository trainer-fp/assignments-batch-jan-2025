# Assignment 12: Working with Other Collections

## Objective
Explore other Scala collections like `Set`, `Map`, and `Vector`.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand when to use different collection types.
- Perform common operations on sets and maps.
- Utilize mutable and immutable versions.

## Tasks

### 1. Sets
- Create a set of unique words from a sentence.
- Perform union and intersection operations with another set.

### 2. Maps
- Implement a word count function that returns a `Map[String, Int]`.

### 3. Vectors
- Use a `Vector` to efficiently access elements by index.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should confirm that set and map operations produce correct results.
- Verify that mutable collections can be modified while immutable ones cannot.
