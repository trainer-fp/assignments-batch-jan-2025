# Assignment 13: Mutable Objects

## Objective
Understand mutable collections and when to use them.

## Learning Outcomes
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable collections.
- Use mutable collections like `ArrayBuffer` and `HashMap`.
- Manage state changes responsibly.

## Tasks

### 1. Mutable Collections
- Use an `ArrayBuffer` to implement a stack with `push` and `pop` operations.

### 2. State Management
- Implement a simple bank account class with methods to deposit and withdraw money.

### 3. Validation
- Unit tests should ensure that the stack behaves correctly.
- Verify that the bank account correctly updates the balance and handles errors (e.g., overdrafts).
