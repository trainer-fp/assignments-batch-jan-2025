# Assignment 15: Type Parameterization

## Objective
Learn to create generic classes and methods using type parameters.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define classes and methods with type parameters.
- Use variance annotations (`+`, `-`).
- Implement type bounds.

## Tasks

### 1. Generic Class
- Create a generic class `Container[T]` with methods to add and retrieve items.

### 2. Variance
- Implement covariance and contravariance examples with custom classes.

### 3. Type Bounds
- Use upper and lower type bounds in methods.

### 4. Validation
- Unit tests should verify that generic classes behave correctly with different types.
- Confirm that variance and type bounds are enforced by the compiler.
