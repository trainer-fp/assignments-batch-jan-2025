# Assignment 14: Scala's Hierarchy

## Objective
Understand Scala's type hierarchy and how all types relate to `Any`, `AnyVal`, and `AnyRef`.

## Learning Outcomes
- Comprehend the root types in Scala.
- Recognize the difference between value types and reference types.
- Use type casting and checking.

## Tasks

### 1. Type Relationships
- Create examples showing that all types are subtypes of `Any`.

### 2. Type Casting
- Implement a function that safely casts an `Any` type to a specific type using pattern matching.

### 3. Validation
- Unit tests should confirm correct type casting and handling of invalid casts.
